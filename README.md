# Ruby on Rails Private-Event implementing Association

In this project we built a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and join other events. Events take place at a specific date and at a location.

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. This will require many-to-many relationships and also to be very conscious about your foreign keys and class names.

#### Did the following tasks:
In this project we created a simple user system and secret posts in Ruby on Rails.
- Created a user Authentication model
- Create Event 
- Created a Event controller
- Created view pages for event, show & form
- Create migration files with table rules
- Add devise to user for Authentication (sign_in ,sign_up)
- Adjust associations between models
- Create migration files with required foreign keys
- visitor model, view, controller setup
- The associations between Event and User model over middle table
